# RedditVertical-
Small chrome extension meant to increase readability using reddit on a vertical monitor.

The main and really only thing this extension currently does is hide the sidebar in reddit comment sections so the sidebar doesn't take up 50% of the screen space on vertical monitors.

You'll have to load this as an unpacked extension or pack it yourself, if you're not familiar with how to do that, you can find that information here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
